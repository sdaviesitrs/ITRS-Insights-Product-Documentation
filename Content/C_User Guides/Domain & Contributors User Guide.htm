                <h2>Why Use Domains in Queries?</h2>
                <p>Domains can be used to filter the results of a query to only the data
emanating from contributors in the domain. This allows you to
contextualise and re-use a particular query across different sources
without having to modify it.</p>
                <p>So for instance you can set up a domain that is all windows servers in a
particular ip range, including only data with tags critical and error.
In this way you can run simple queries on this domain, knowing that the
appropriate data (i.e. critical and error) is always dynamically
included in real-time.</p>
                <h2>So what are the benefits of domains?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dynamic sets of contributors - If a new sensor is added or metadata of any existing sensor is changed, the domains and any running queries within the domains would adjust automatically to operate on the updated set of contributors.</li>
                    <li>Querying convenience - Let's say in this smart city there are two local authorities for the West and the East. Creating a different domain for each area would be helpful as the local authorities are only concerned with the data from air sensors in their respective area and do not want to specify the location each time in their queries.</li>
                    <li>Control access to data in an organisation - If we scale this example to a smart city with lots of different types of sensors and streams of data, domains would be a good way to control access to data so that employees would only have access to the data from the contributors that concern them.</li>
                    <li>Shareability - Imagine a smart city with lots of different local authorities with the same querying needs. The key queries only need to be created in one authority and then shared across all of the different areas.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="section" id="creating-a-domain">
                <h2>How do you Create a Domain?</h2>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Output.Null"> Domains are dynamic groups contributors. For example, in a smart city, we can create a domain for all contributors (sensors and other smart devices) in the West and one for contributors in the East. This means, for example, that any queries made to various streams within the 'West' domain will only operate on data coming from contributors in the West. Domains are a useful tool to organise streaming data especially if you consider that contributors can publish data to multiple streams.</p>
                <div class="line-block">
                    <div class="line">You can create a domain by selecting the domain menu and clicking on
the <strong>+</strong> in the top right.</div>
                    <div class="line">
                        <img alt="insights_working_domains_image1" src="../Resources/Images/DomainMenu.png" />
                    </div>
                    <div class="line">This brings you into the domain editor where you can specify your
domain name and importantly filter your contributors. The contributor
types will be shown automatically for you to add your filter to.</div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    <img alt="insights_working_domains_image2" src="../Resources/Images/DomainEditor.png" />
                </p>
                <p>Once you have selected save then you will be presented with your
domain's home page with details of the included contributors and
streams. From here creating a new notebook for the screen is as easy as
selecting the <strong>+ Add A Notebook to this domain</strong> button at the bottom
of the home page. When you return to your domain homepage from the menu
all the notebooks for that domain will be displayed on the page.</p>
                <p>Your domain notebooks will also appear in the Notebook menu <img alt="insights_working_domains_image3" src="../Resources/Images/NotebookIcon.png" /></p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="cloning-a-domain">
                <h3>Cloning a Domain</h3>
                <p>You can easily clone a domain from the domain menu selecting the
<img alt="insights_working_domains_image4" src="../Resources/Images/CopyIcon.png" />, this allows you to duplicate all the existing notebooks,
queries etc. on that domain and move it to a different domain. So if for
example I have lots of analytics running on my European IT operations, I
can clone the domain and by just updating the domain definition in the
clone have all the same capabilities immediately over my North American
operations.</p>

        <h2>Contributor</h2>
        <p>In a blog post on <a href="https://valo.io/blog/post/what-are-streams-in-valo">streams</a>, we indirectly assigned metadata about each sensor (eg. area) inside the stream's schema. Because this sensor-specific data does not change with every new event, it may make sense to take it out of the real-time payloads and store it separately as contributor metadata. This means that the unchanging metadata does not need to be POSTed to the stream each time (and potentially wastefully stored), but instead, can be stored once externally. By storing information against a contributor, we are also able to run queries against subsets of the data such as sensors from a particular location or manufacturer.</p>
        <p>To set up contributors in Valo, we first need to register the sensors' "contributor type" with an HTTP PUT command with the json schema below. This specifies the metadata fields that we can store for each air quality sensor. In the schema below we have simply defined the contributor type as 'sensor' since we can potentially have different types of sensors with the same contributor type. Note that it is essential to have a field (in this case, 'id') that is a unique identifier for each sensor and has the type 'contributor'.</p><pre>
{
“schema” {
    type: “record”,
    properties: {
        id: {"type": “contributor”, "definition": "sensor"},
        area: {"type": “string”},
        manufacturer: {"type": “string”}
        }
    }
}</pre>
        <p>The air quality stream's schema (below) should also have the 'id' field of type 'contributor' in order to connect the real time air quality measurements with their corresponding sensor's metadata.</p><pre>
{
  "schema": {
    "topDef": {
      "type": "record",
      "properties":
        "id": {"type": “contributor”, "definition": "sensor"},
        "carbonm": { "type": "double"},
        "nitrouso": { "type": "double"},
        "sampleTime": { "type": "datetime"}
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>
        <p>Let's say that we have just installed two new sensors in a smart city. After having established the contributor type, we can now assign the specific metadata to each of our sensors with an HTTP PUT command.</p>
        <p>Here's an example of what an air quality payload would look like with the contributor id field:</p><pre>{
    "id": "3450af"
    "carbonm": 0.05,
    "nitrouso": 0.04,
    "sampleTime": "Thu Jul 7 2016 15:03:53"     
}</pre>
