        <p>An <MadCap:variable name="General.Product Name Insights&#160;(abbreviated)"></MadCap:variable> notebook is very similar to the paper notebook on your
desk, it is a place where you can record your findings, try hypothesis,
jot notes and build up understanding. You can run searches and queries
from your notebook, review results in a number of different graphing
options and decide to keep or delete them. Of course you can have a
number of different notebooks and you can also choose share them with
others.</p>
        <p>So in our smart street example if I want to analyze the energy usage in
house number 4 then I open a notebook and select House04, I am then able
to perform searches and queries against that domain, from a simplistic
search that requests how many times ‘kettle’ appears in that stream
(that may represent every time a kettle is turned on and off) over a
given time frame to complex queries like what is the combined electricity
usage of all the smart appliances in the house from 6pm until midnight,
displaying the results in a choice of graphical or tabular ways in the
notebook. Because ITRS Insights also has a time series repository, which
means it understands to some extend the concepts of time, and also comes
with some complex algorithms built into the query language then it is
also possible to run a single query that is sophisticated enough to spot
anomalies in the data. So for instance if aging Mrs Brown at No 4 always
watches her favorite soap at 7pm every evening and straight afterward
gets up and makes a cup of tea then the notebook can help you spot that
this evening she didn’t switch the kettle on at 8pm, which may be cause
for concern. Because it is real-time then the queries can immediately
identify anomalies, however you can also run the same thing against
historic data to find previous patterns and areas for further
investigation.</p>
        <p>As with a paper notebook these investigations and discoveries can be
saved and shared with other people and added to; and unlike paper they
can also be rerun with just the touch of a button.</p>
        <h2><a name="Dashboard"></a>Dashboard</h2>
        <p>Dashboards provide an aggregated view of the visualizations to enable you to see the results of key queries in real-time.</p>
        <p>Important query results and visualizations created in a Notebook can be send to a dashboard where changes can be seen in real-time.</p>
        <h2>Working With Dashboards  <img src="../Resources/Images/DashboardIcon.png" /></h2>
        <p>To create a dashboard, select the dashboard icon from the menu on the left
hand side of the home page (or in fact any page).</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="insights_working_dashboards_image1" src="../Resources/Images/DashboardMenu01.png">
            </img>
        </p>
        <div class="line-block">
            <div class="line">The Notebooks menu will pop out, to create a new one then hit the +
button.</div>
            <div class="line">This creates a new dashboard for you with a default name. If you want to change the name of the dashboard them select the edit icon <img alt="insights_working_dashboards_image3" src="../Resources/Images/EditIcon.png"></img> edit the dashboard details as you choose</div>

            </img>
        </p>
        <p>and then save the changes using the button at the bottom left of the screen <img alt="insights_working_dashboards_image4" src="../Resources/Images/YesTick.png"></img>.</p>
        <p>Your dashboard is now ready to send query results to.</p>
        <div class="section" id="populating-a-dashboard">
            <h2>Populating A Dashboard</h2>
            <p>Once you have a dashboard then you need to select which queries from your <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">:doc:`notebook &lt;working_with_notebooks&gt;`</span></a> you wish to publish there.</p>
            <p>When you have run a query in a notebook and have either a table or selected a visualisation you can send that visualisation to a dashboard by selecting the Send To Dashboard icon src="../Resources/Images/ from the top right of the query panel. This passes you into the Send to dashboard wizard where you can specify which of your already created dashboards you wish to send the query results to</p>
            <p>
                <img alt="insights_working_dashboards_image6" src="../Resources/Images/SendToDash01.png">
                </img>
            </p>
            <p>then configure the visualisation by giving it a name</p>

            </p>
            <p>and previewing what will appear on the dashboard before select to send it. You will receive a brief message on the screen to confirm it has been sent and to where.</p>

        <h2>Working With Notebooks <img alt="insights_working_notebooks_image0" src="../Resources/Images/NotebookIcon.png" /></h2>
        <p>By creating an Insights notebook you are creating a window into your
data, with the ability to analyse your data, visualise the results, and
then save the queries to run again, at any time, over the same, updated
or different data.</p>
        <p>To create a notebook, select the notebook icon from the menu on the left
hand side of the home page (or in fact any page).</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="insights_working_notebooks_image1" src="../Resources/Images/NotebookMenuOption.png" />
        </p>
        <div class="line-block">
            <div class="line">The Notebooks menu will pop out, to create a new one then hit the +
button.</div>
            <div class="line">This brings you into the create notebook page, there you can select or
create a collection, name your notebook and add a description.</div>
        </div>
        <p>
            <img alt="insights_working_notebooks_image2" src="../Resources/Images/CreateNotebook1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Hit the save button and you new notebook is created and opened ready for
work.</p>
        <p>At the top left of the notebook page selecting the <strong>+</strong> will enable you
to choose between creating a <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">:doc:`search &lt;searching_data&gt;`</span></a>, <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">:doc:`querying
your data &lt;querying_data&gt;`</span></a> or writing some free form text notes as
your first entry.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="insights_working_notebooks_image3" src="../Resources/Images/CreateNotebook2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In your notebook you can create queries and searches that will be saved
automatically in the notebook, you can delete unwanted queries using the
<img alt="insights_working_notebooks_image4" src="../Resources/Images/DeleteIcon.png" /> button.</p>
        <p>You can runrerun all queries and searches in a notebook by selecting the
Run button <img alt="insights_working_notebooks_image5" src="../Resources/Images/NotebookRunButton.png" /> at the top right of the Notebook.</p>
