        <h2 class="nokeyline">Introduction</h2>

        <p id="Example">So in our smart street example if I want to analyze the energy usage in
house number 4 then I open a notebook and select House04, I am then able
to perform searches and queries against that domain, from a simplistic
search that requests how many times ‘kettle’ appears in that stream
(that may represent every time a kettle is turned on and off) over a
given time frame to complex queries like what is the combined electricity
usage of all the smart appliances in the house from 6pm until midnight,
displaying the results in a choice of graphical or tabular ways in the
notebook. </p>
        <p id="Example">Because ITRS Insights also has a time series repository, which
means it understands to some extend the concepts of time, and also comes
with some complex algorithms built into the query language then it is
also possible to run a single query that is sophisticated enough to spot
anomalies in the data. </p>
        <p id="Example">So for instance if aging Mrs Brown at No 4 always
watches her favorite soap at 7pm every evening and straight afterward
gets up and makes a cup of tea then the notebook can help you spot that
this evening she didn’t switch the kettle on at 8pm, which may be cause
for concern. Because it is real-time then the queries can immediately
identify anomalies, however you can also run the same thing against
historic data to find previous patterns and areas for further
investigation.</p>
        <p>As with a paper notebook, these investigations and discoveries can be
saved and shared with other people and added to; and unlike paper they
can also be rerun with just the touch of a button.</p>
        <h2><a name="Dashboard"></a>Dashboard</h2>
        <p><strong class="green">Dashboards </strong>provide an aggregated view of your <strong class="green">visualizations </strong>to enable you to see the results of key in real-time. Once you've created one or more queries or free text searches in a <strong class="green">notebook</strong>, important results and visualizations can be sent to a dashboard where changes can be seen in real-time.</p>
        <p>For more about visualizing your results, see <MadCap:xref href="Visualizing Results User Guide.htm">[%=General.Product Name&#160;Insights (Full)%] Visualizing Results User Guide</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2 class="nokeyline">The Dashboard interface</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/interface_dashboard.PNG" class="screenshotsmedium" />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/UI Definition Active Tab.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/UI Definition Breadcrumbs.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Visualization </strong>- a visualization added to your Dashboard from a Notebook</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/UI Definition Edit.flsnp" />
            </li>

                <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/UI Definition Delete.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li><strong>Resize Handle</strong> - grab and drag to resize the visualization</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can drag and drop the visualizations in a Dashboard, allowing you to order the space as you wish.&#160;In addition, you can resize each of the visualizations to increase or decrease their prominence in the view - when you do so, other visualization panels in the Dashboard will resize accordingly. </p>
        <p>Your panel selections, positions and sizes are saved automatically. </p>
        <h2 class="nokeyline">Working With Dashboards  </h2>
        <p>To create a dashboard, select the dashboard icon from the menu on the left
hand side of the home page (or in fact any page).</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <div class="line-block">
            <div class="line">The Notebooks menu will pop out, to create a new one then hit the +
button.</div>
            <div class="line">This creates a new dashboard for you with a default name. If you want to change the name of the dashboard them select the edit icon  edit the dashboard details as you choose</div>
        </div>
        <p>and then save the changes using the button at the bottom left of the screen </p>
        <p>Your dashboard is now ready to send query results to.</p>
        <div class="section" id="populating-a-dashboard">
            <h2>Populating A Dashboard</h2>
            <p>Once you have a dashboard then you need to select which queries from your <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">:doc:`notebook &lt;working_with_notebooks&gt;`</span></a> you wish to publish there.</p>
            <p>When you have run a query in a notebook and have either a table or selected a visualisation you can send that visualisation to a dashboard by selecting the Send To Dashboard icon src="../Resources/Images/ from the top right of the query panel. This passes you into the Send to dashboard wizard where you can specify which of your already created dashboards you wish to send the query results to</p>
            <p>then configure the visualisation by giving it a name</p>
            <p>and previewing what will appear on the dashboard before select to send it. You will receive a brief message on the screen to confirm it has been sent and to where.</p>
        </div>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Working With Notebooks </h2>
        <p>By creating an Insights notebook you are creating a window into your
data, with the ability to analyze your data, visualize the results, and
then save the queries to run again, at any time, over the same, updated
or different data.</p>
