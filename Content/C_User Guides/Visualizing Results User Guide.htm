            <p><MadCap:variable name="General.Product Name&#160;Insights (Full)" /> provides a number of different ways to visualize your data
and the outcome of your queries and analysis. Once you have run the
query the relevant chart options are displayed at the top to choose
from.</p>
            <div class="section" id="tables-image0">
                <h3>Tables <img alt="image0" src="../Resources/Images/TableButton.png" /></h3>
                <p>The most simple, and default, manner of displaying query results is a
table</p>

                </p>
                <p>Tables can be sorted by selecting the appropriate column. For instance selecting the

                <p>Selecting the column chart an axis selection that makes sense is automatically chosen, so from the example above selecting the Column button results in the following visualisation:

                </p>
                <p>Depending on the contents of your query return you can change the axis
configurations and also group by certain values.</p>

                <h3>Spark lines <img alt="image6" src="../Resources/Images/SparkButton.png" /></h3>
                <p>A sparkline is a very small line chart, typically drawn without axes or
coordinates and presents the general shape of the variation (typically
over time) in some measurement.</p>
                <p>For example in our USA flight data we can see what the pattern of
lateness looks like for each carrier.</p>

found. So for instance if we take an ECG stream then we can run a query
to emit and chart the following. With the anomaly displayed underneath
and any area where this is breached highlighted on the main chart.</p>

                <p>A line chart or line graph is a type of chart which displays information
as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line
segments. The measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis
value) and joined with straight line segments. A line chart is often
used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series
– thus the line is often drawn chronologically.</p>

                <h3>Bubble Chart <img alt="image12" src="../Resources/Images/BubbleButton.png" /></h3>
                <p>A bubble chart is a type of chart that displays three dimensions of
data. Each entity with its triplet (v1, v2, v3) of associated data is
plotted as a disk that expresses two of the vi values through the disk's
xy location and the third through its size.</p>
                <p>For example with the query:</p>
                <div class="system-message"> <pre class="literal-block" xml:space="preserve">
from /streams/demo/infrastructure/cpu
select process, host, sampleTime, kernel, user, kernel as kernel1, user as user1, kernel as kernel2, user as user2, kernel as kernel3, user as user3
</pre></div>

                <h3>Scatterplot Chart <img alt="image14" src="../Resources/Images/ScatterButton.png" /></h3>
                <p>A scatterplot is a useful summary of a set of bivariate data (two
variables),it gives a good visual picture of the relationship between
the two variables, and aids the interpretation of the correlation
coefficient or regression model.</p>
                <p>For example from the following query on USA flight data we can compare
the distance travelled vs flight time for flights departing on a given
hour. As you would expect there is a strong correlation, but you can
also see some of the outliers where those carriers seemed to take longer
to fly a given journey.... if your aim is to get home as soon as
possible make be you would chose one of the others.</p>
