            <p id="concept_definition">The <strong class="green">semi-structured repository</strong> (<strong class="green">SSR</strong>) is based on Lucene which provides very powerful text search capabilities. Even though Lucene is geared towards indexing text, it also has very good index support for numerical data. However, if the data contains purely numerical fields the TSR might be a better fit as a repository for this kind of data.</p>
